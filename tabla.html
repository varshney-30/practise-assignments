            HISTORY & FEATURES
        </h1>
        <P>
            The tabla consists of two single-headed, barrel-shaped small drums of 
            slightly different sizes and shapes: 
            baya and daya for left and right drums respectively.
            Ustad Zakir Hussain performing at Konark, Odisha. 
            This illustrates the common sitting position used by tabla players.
            The smaller drum, played with the dominant hand, is called dayan
            (literally "right" side ), dāhina, siddha or chattū,
             but is correctly called the "tabla." It is made from a conical piece 
             of mostly teak and rosewood hollowed out to approximately half of its total depth. 
             The daya tabla is played by the musician's right hand (dominant hand), 
             and is about 15 centimetres (~6 in) in diameter and 25 centimetres (~10 in) high. 
             The drum is tuned to a specific note, usually either the tonic,
              dominant or subdominant of the soloist's key and thus complements the melody.
            This is the ground note of the raga called Sa (tonic in India music).
            The tuning range is limited although different dāyāñs are produced 
            in different sizes, each with a different range. Cylindrical wood blocks,
             known as gatta, are inserted between the strap and the shell allowing
            tension to be adjusted by their vertical positioning. 
        Fine tuning is achieved while striking vertically on the braided portion
         of the head using a small, heavy hammer. While tabla usually features two drums,
          a tabla tarang may consist of 10-16 dayas to perform melodies based on several ragas.
          The baya tabla is a bit bigger and deep kettledrum shaped, about 20 centimetres 
          (~8 in) in diameter and 25 centimetres (~10 in) in height. 
          It played with the non-dominant hand, is called bāyāñ (literally "left") duggī
           or dhāmā (correctly called "dagga"), has a much deeper bass tone, much like 
           its distant cousin, the kettle drum. The bāyāñs can be found to be made up of
            many different types of materials. Brass is the most common, copper is more expensive,
             but generally held to be the best, while aluminum and steel are often found
              in inexpensive models. Sometimes wood is used, especially in old bāyāñs from
               the Punjab. Clay is also used, although not favored for durability;
                these are generally found in the North-East region of Bengal. 
                The baya construction and tuning is about a fifth to an octave
                 below that of the daya drum. The musician uses his hand's heel 
                 pressure to change the pitch and tone colour of each drum during a performance.
