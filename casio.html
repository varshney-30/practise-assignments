         HISTORY:
    </h1>
    <p>
    In 1980 Casio released the Casiotone 201, its first electronic keyboard. 
    As a compact and attractively priced unit that could play sounds from various instruments,
     this new product drew acclaim from music lovers around the world.  Casio subsequently developed 
     numerous features that were only possible using digital instrument technology, including  one-touch 
     auto-accompaniment, memory capacity to record and playback songs, auto-play, a melody guide function 
     that guides users through a song by lighting up the keys, and sampling technology for recording any 
     sound for use as a sound source.  Casio also broadened into other instruments for people who enjoy 
     creating music, releasing digital drum kits, digital guitars and digital wind instruments. 
     In addition to electronic keyboards, in recent years Casio has been stepping up efforts 
     to expand the popularity of digital pianos. <br>
