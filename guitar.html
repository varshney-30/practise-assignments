        <h1> HSTORY & FEATURES:</h1>
        <p>
            The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typically has six strings. 
            It is held flat against the player's body and played by strumming or plucking the string
            s with the dominant hand, while simultaneously pressing selected strings against frets with
             the fingers of the opposite hand. A plectrum or individual finger picks may be used to strike the strings. 
             The sound of the guitar is projected either acoustically,
             by means of a resonant chamber on the instrument, or amplified by an electronic pickup and an amplifier.
             <br>
            There are three main types of modern guitar: <br> The classical guitar (Spanish guitar/nylon-string guitar); 
            the steel-string acoustic guitar or electric guitar; and the Hawaiian guitar (played across the player's lap). <br>
            Traditional acoustic guitars include the flat top guitar (typically with a large sound hole) or 
            an archtop guitar, which is sometimes called a "jazz guitar". 
            The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings' vibration,
             amplified by the hollow body of the guitar, which acts as a resonating chamber. <br>
              The classical Spanish guitar is often played as a solo instrument using a 
              comprehensive fingerstyle technique where each string is plucked individually
               by the player's fingers, as opposed to being strummed. The term "finger-picking"
             can also refer to a specific tradition of folk, blues, bluegrass, and country guitar playing 
             in the United States. <br>
            Electric guitars, first patented in 1937, use a pickup and amplifier  
            that made the instrument loud enough to be heard, 
            but also enabled manufacturing guitars with a solid block of wood 
            needing no resonant chamber. A wide array of electronic effects 
            units became possible including reverb and distortion (or "overdrive"). 
            Solid-body guitars began to dominate the guitar market during the 1960s and 1970s;
             they are less prone to unwanted acoustic feedback. As with acoustic guitars,
              there are a number of types of electric guitars, including hollowbody guitars, 
              archtop guitars (used in jazz guitar, blues and rockabilly) and solid-body guitars,
               which are widely used in rock music.

    <h1>SIZE:</h1>
    <p>
        A typical full-size guitar is around 38 inches long (96.5cm) with a 
        scale length of around 25.5 inches (64.8cm). 
        This varies widely across brands and guitar types. 
        If you have a guitar and you want to find out whether 
        it is a full-size guitar, the first thing to check is the scale length.
